Background:
REST_Autonomouspowerwheels was created by a small group of highschool students who wanted to make and design our own mini autonomous car using the BeagleBone Black. REST stands for Roseville Engineering, Science and Technology.
We have competed for 3 years with our autonomous car against other schools and won the Square One trophy and Professionalism trophies aswell.

This code is dependent on Adafruits python library to work with BeagleBoneBlack

This also gives useful references and functions that will help you out if you get stuck.
