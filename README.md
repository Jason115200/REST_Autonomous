Background:
We are a group of Highschool students who are intreasted and learning the process of autonomous vehivle design. Over the years we have learned the logic and the process that it takes for an autonomous car to function. We have decided to implement these functions on a small scale using a power wheels kit where the computer dricing the car is a BeagleBone BLack Wireless. We have competed for  3 years with our autonomous car against other schools and won the 2017 Square One trophy and Professionalism trophy aswell. We as a club are only one branch of the total "R.E.S.T" club. REST stands for Roseville Engineering, Science and Technology.

This code is dependent on Adafruits python library to work with BeagleBoneBlack

This also gives useful references and functions that will help you out if you get stuck.

We are open to any and all questions, advice and critiques.
